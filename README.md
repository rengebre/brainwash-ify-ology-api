# BRAINWASH

## Introduction
---
Over the last few years, while working through the pandemic, weâ€™ve been spending a lot more time at home and people have turned to social media to stay connected with others to fill that extra time.

As we know, many of the popular social media platforms, like Instagram and TikTok, have been proven to be quite detrimental to our mental health, so we wanted to create a platform which would foster a healthier online community where people can connect with others in a social context, all while consuming more positive content.

Users come to Brainwash to learn new skills, improve existing passions, and share their own knowledge through various media types with an online community of other passionate lifelong learners - Think master class meets instagram & youtube.

Brainwash is our submission for the final project for the lighthouse labs web development bootcamp. Over an enjoyable 10 days, the creators: Russell Engebretson, Sophie Oliver and Katie Herda, worked together to build out an MVP of the platform, expanding on knowledge learned in the bootcamp, to add functionality that would allow users to create and consume content, and communicate with other Brainwashers.

## Repository
---
This is the back end repository for our app, if you would like to view the front end React repo click [Brainwash](https://github.com/rengebre/brainwash-ify-ology)

We built the back end using a Ruby on Rails API, with active record running a postgres database for user and post data, along with a combination of active storage and Cloudinary to allow for storing video, audio and image files to the cloud.

With the short 10 day timeline for producing the platform, there are several inneficiencies with the layout of our backend, but for a proof of concept we feel it works quite well. Updates to come, time permitted:

- refactor several returned data structures from arrays to hashes or JSON objects for easier data management on the front end
- reduce the number of queries to our database
- namespace all our routes with `/api/*`
- update how we fetch active storage urls using cloudinary. We currently fetch the cloudinary url every time we want to retrieve a file, which will be a slow process communicating with a cloud server. Instead we should have the cloudinary url returned on creation or update of an attachment and store that static url in our respective postgres database tables for faster retrieval times
- all Auth0 is done on the front end using social logins and authentication, it would be nice to fully authenticate the backend as well.


## Project Layout
---
This application follows the typical Ruby on Rails folder structure, except we built it using Rails API, so our controllers inherit `ActionController::API`.

# Running the Repo locally for development

Install Ruby 3.0.2, and rails 6.1.4.1

Create a postgres DB and sign up for a Cloudinary account.

Create a config/database.yml file with the following skeleton:
```rb
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: [your db name here]
  pool: 5
  username: [your db username]
  password: [your db password]
  timeout: 5000
```

create a .env file in the root directory with the following skeleton:
```rb
CLOUD_NAME=[your cloudinary name here]
CL_API_KEY=[your cloudinary API key here]
CL_API_SECRET=[your cloudinary secret here]
```

install dependencies:

```rb
bundle install
```

populate populate your db:
```rb
rails db:reset
```
Run server
```rb
bin/rails server
```

The server should start on localhost port 3000.
